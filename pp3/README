List of files: 
	mapping.txt    - contains mapping of data structures to mys0x
	generator0.cc  - basic generator that inserts some numbers in ascending order and finds the numbers in ascending order
	generator1.cc  - inserts numbers in ascending order, finds random numbers (comparing against 
	generator2.cc  - used to find which one is the hash table with chaining (comparing against results from generator0)
	generator3.cc  - inserts/removes immediately in ascending order, used to find the bst with tombstones and the hashtable with double hashing
	generator4.cc  - inserts in ascending order, finds the same value over and over again (used to single out move_to_front unsorted vector and the splay tree and comparing with gen1, can see which one is the avl tree (everything the avl tree does is O(nlogn) )
